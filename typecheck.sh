# Runs the Checker Framework's Nullness Checker over Beam, using a locally built Checker Framework.
# The Checker Framework's continuous integration jobs run this script.
#
# Usage: ./typecheck.sh GROUP
# where GROUP is one of:
#   part1, part2  type-check one group of modules
#   all           type-check every module
#   list          print each group's compileJava tasks, without running them
#
# The modules are every Java project that applies the Checker Framework Gradle plugin without
# skipping it.  They are discovered at run time, so modules that are added to Beam are type-checked
# without changes to this script.
#
# Environment:
#   CHECKERFRAMEWORK  a Checker Framework checkout in which `./gradlew assembleForJavac` has run.
#                     Defaults to ../checker-framework.
#
# Run Gradle on JDK 21: Beam's Gradle version cannot run on JDK 25.  Do not pass -Pjava21Home or
# -Pjava25Home, which make BeamModulePlugin skip the Checker Framework.

# Patterns matched against Gradle project paths, in which `*` matches any sequence of characters.
# part1 is the Dataflow runner and the chain of modules it depends on (:sdks:java:core,
# :sdks:java:io:google-cloud-platform), which must be type-checked one after another and so bounds
# the time of any group that contains them.  Any module that no pattern in PART1 matches is in
# part2.  With 4 Gradle workers, part1 takes about 36 minutes and part2 about 31 minutes.  More
# groups would not be faster, because every group type-checks :sdks:java:core and part1's chain
# cannot be split.
